        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>The 11 March 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake (Mw 9.0) produced megathrust displacements of at least 40 m. The resulting tsunami devastated the Honshu coast southwest of regions struck by earthquake-generated tsunami in 1611, 1896 and 1933. This paper discusses the potential for great extensional faulting in the outer trench slope or outer rise region seaward of the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake rupture zone.</p>

        <h3>Key Points</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Large interplate thrusting earthquakes are often followed by intraplate extensional-faulting aftershocks.</li>
          <li>There is concern about a possible great outer trench-slope earthquake seaward of the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake.</li>
          <li>Estimated stress perturbations of 5-10 bars in the outer rise region.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Main Findings</h3>
        <p>The paper highlights the relationship between large interplate thrusting earthquakes and subsequent intraplate extensional-faulting aftershocks. It discusses the potential for a great outer trench-slope earthquake seaward of the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake, along a southwestward extension of the 1933 fault zone.</p>

        <p>The authors estimate stress perturbations of at least 5-10 bars for outer rise normal fault geometries based on mainshock slip models. They note that while it's uncertain whether a future great trench slope event will occur, the potential tsunamigenic hazard can be gauged by the huge inundations accompanying the 1933 rupture.</p>

        <h3>Implications</h3>
        <p>This research underscores the importance of monitoring and studying the outer trench slope region following major subduction zone earthquakes. It suggests that the risk of additional large earthquakes and tsunamis may persist even after a major event like the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake.</p>
