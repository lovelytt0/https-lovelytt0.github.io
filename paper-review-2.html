        <h2>Paper Review: Regional extent of the large coseismic slip zone of the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku‐Oki earthquake delineated by on‐fault aftershocks</h2>
        <p class="date">2019-10-28</p>
        <p><em>Authors: Aitaro Kato and Toshihiro Igarashi</em></p>
        
        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>This paper delineates the outer edge of the large-slip zone of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake in detail, based on the sharp density contrast observed for interplate, repeating, and down-dip compressional earthquakes induced by the mainshock. The seismicity rate of interplate earthquakes changed significantly after the mainshock, likely due to stress perturbations caused by the large slip. The authors use this information as qualitative constraints in constructing their model.</p>

        <h3>Key Points</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Aftershocks occurring on or very near the mainshock rupture plane are quite rare in large-slip regions.</li>
          <li>The study delineates the outer edge of the large-slip zone with higher spatial resolution than previous studies using fault source models.</li>
          <li>The model incorporates fine-scale heterogeneities of fault slip associated with the Tohoku-Oki earthquake.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Main Findings</h3>
        <h4>1. Aftershock Distribution</h4>
        <p>The study analyzed well-documented CMTs with M ≥ 4.0 that occurred within 1 year after the mainshock. Key observations include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Low aftershock density over a wide region at depths shallower than about 35 km offshore of Miyagi, Iwate, and Fukushima.</li>
          <li>Dense concentrations of interplate aftershocks at depths greater than about 35 km.</li>
          <li>Intensive interplate earthquake activity in isolated, shallow regions offshore of Iwate, Fukushima, and Ibaraki.</li>
          <li>Two M7 aftershocks along the northern and southern extensions of the Tohoku-Oki mainshock rupture area.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Defining the Outer Edge of the Zone of Large Coseismic Slip</h4>
        <p>The authors used seismicity rate changes to indicate that the accumulated stress along the Tohoku-Oki rupture was almost entirely released from the large-slip zone into its surroundings.</p>

        <h4>3. Comparison with Previous Models</h4>
        <p>The study compared their findings with fault source models from Yokata et al. and Iinuma et al., as well as back-projection results and strong-motion-generation areas.</p>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>The authors suggest that in some areas, the mainshock rupture might have reached the down-dip limit of interplate seismicity, resulting in almost entire release of accumulated stress within local seismogenic zones.</p>

        <h3>Implications</h3>
        <p>This research provides a more detailed understanding of the slip distribution during the Tohoku-Oki earthquake, which can improve our knowledge of megathrust earthquake dynamics and contribute to better seismic hazard assessments in subduction zones.</p>
